# Hi there 👋

I'm a rising-junior at **MIT majoring in Computer Science and Engineering**. My interests span machine learning, distributed systems, and intelligent agent design. I enjoy building efficient, scalable solutions—whether it’s improving complex codebases, designing distributed architectures, or creating innovative AI-powered tools. Always exploring, always building. _This was painful to write_
